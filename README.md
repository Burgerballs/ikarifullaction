# Ikari Full Action
**Ikari Full Action** is an open-source Syobon Action fangame created by Team Jub!! A congregation of hooligans that make the world just a little more epic!

The current Ikariers are:
* Pixa - Artist/Animator
*  Saki - Artist
*  Burgerballs - Programmer, Level Designer and Musician
*  Nuv - Musician
*  Raven/Null - Professional Existing Connoisseur

This repo is in super duper work in progress mode and that means things are a little evil and not worky atm, expect the game to be more uhh... gamey! in the coming few months!
