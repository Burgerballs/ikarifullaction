Lilly
She/Her
Species: Long-eared Cat (after printer-related injury) Cat (before printer-related injury)

Lilly is a retired store clerk who left her job for unknown reasons. She is extremely charismatic and easy-going. 
She believes in justice against pure evil, and views herself as the one to do it.

Despite Lilly attempting to come off as a cabbit, 
Lilly is actually a cat, with disproportionately long ears after an injury relating to her ears getting stuck in a printer roller, 
after the injury she was granted extreme speed and can hear things clearly from miles away, 
she actively tries to avoid conversations about cabbits because she isn't one, 
but is okay with talking with real ones if they aren't so picky about how she looks. 
She faked being a cabbit because she was worried that people would call the ambulance due to the injury and she would be in financial ruin, 
little did she know that not many people really cares about it that much.

She is friends with almost everyone in the village, she finds it odd how Ikari insists that she's an aquaintance around others,
but plays along in order to make sure that attention is brought away.
